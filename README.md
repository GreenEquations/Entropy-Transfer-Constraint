# 🧠 Entropy Transfer Constraint in Cognitive Compression Systems

## Overview

This theorem models how cognitive and computational systems collapse under entropy overload. When the rate of entropy intake exceeds dissipation and temporary buffering, the system reaches a collapse threshold. This concept applies across AI models, human cognition, information systems, and theoretical computation.

## 🔢 Theorem Statement

Let:

- ET(t): Entropy intake rate  
- ED(t): Entropy dissipation rate  
- δ(t): Temporary buffering capacity  
- Θ: Collapse threshold

**Condition:**  
If the cumulative entropy differential exceeds Θ, collapse occurs:

    ∫[t₀ to tₙ] (ET(t) - ED(t)) dt > Θ  → Collapse

## 🔬 Scientific Basis

- **Thermodynamics**: Inspired by Landauer’s Principle  
- **Information Theory**: Based on Shannon entropy thresholds  
- **Cognitive Science**: Mirrors mental overload and memory collapse  
- **AI Models**: Applies to LLMs and transformers under semantic noise  

---

## 🧪 Testable Predictions

- Transformers under sustained adversarial inputs will show attention collapse.
- BLEU/BERT scores will degrade sharply near the entropy threshold.
- Spiking neural networks will destabilize without sufficient inhibitory feedback.
- Human subjects overloaded with high entropy stimuli will show recall failure.

## 📊 Simulation Design (Proposed)

- Use a transformer model with increasing entropy input.
- Track divergence in embeddings, perplexity, and attention focus.
- Identify tipping points tied to δ(t) and Θ.
