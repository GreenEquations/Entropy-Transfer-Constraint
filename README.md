Entropy Transfer Constraint in Cognitive Compression Systems
Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Entropy Transfer Constraint in Cognitive Compression Systems theorem! This theorem formalizes how cognitive and computational systems engaged in semantic compression experience representational degradation or collapse when overwhelmed by excessive entropy intake. This work has implications for AI safety, neuroscience, and information theory, as it models the relationship between incoming data entropy, system processing capacity, and the risk of system failure.

Theorem Statement:
A cognitive or computational system will collapse if the rate of entropy intake (

Scientific Foundation
This theorem is rooted in principles from thermodynamics, information theory, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. It draws inspiration from Landauer's Principle in computation, Shannon entropy in information theory, and cognitive overload theories in humans, proposing that systems (whether biological or artificial) have finite capacities to process and integrate information.
