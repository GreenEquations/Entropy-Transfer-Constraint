# 🧠 Entropy Transfer Constraint in Cognitive Compression Systems

## Overview
This theorem models how cognitive and computational systems collapse under entropy overload. When the rate of entropy intake exceeds dissipation and temporary buffering, the system reaches a collapse threshold. This concept applies across AI models, human cognition, information systems, and theoretical computation.

## 🔢 Theorem Statement

Let:

- \( E_T(t) \): Entropy intake rate  
- \( E_D(t) \): Entropy dissipation rate  
- \( \delta(t) \): Temporary buffering capacity  
- \( \Theta \): Collapse threshold

Then for all \( t \), if:

\[
\int_{t_0}^{t_n} \left( E_T(t) - E_D(t) \right) \, dt > \Theta
\quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{System Collapse}
\]

## 🔬 Scientific Basis

- **Thermodynamics**: Inspired by Landauer’s Principle  
- **Information Theory**: Based on Shannon entropy thresholds  
- **Cognitive Science**: Mirrors mental overload, memory collapse  
- **AI Models**: Applies to LLMs and transformers under semantic noise  

---

## 🧪 Testable Predictions

- Transformers under sustained adversarial inputs will show attention collapse.
- BLEU/BERT scores will degrade sharply near the entropy threshold.
- Spiking neural nets will destabilize without sufficient inhibitory feedback.
- Human subjects overloaded with high entropy stimuli will show recall failure.

---

## 📊 Simulation Design (Proposed)

- Use a transformer model with increasing entropy input.
- Track divergence in embeddings, perplexity, and attention focus.
- Identify tipping points tied to \( \delta(t) \) and \( \Theta \).
